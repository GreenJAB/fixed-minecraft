# ATTENTION: We are forking Fixed Minecraft
## green_jab is a transphobe, homophobe, bigot, and overall a poor project lead
## !!! NOTE: DON'T HARASS JAB OR ANYONE ELSE OVER THIS !!!
For the reasons above and more, we have decided to leave the Fixed Minecraft project and make our own version of it: Harmony and Melody. We heavily disagree with Jab's behavior, but instead of causing conflict and drama by fighting against it here, we have decided to just leave and move forward on our own. As much as this may be a surprise to those here, we felt it was necessary to make these issues clear and take action against them. Neglecting the situation wouldn't be right.

Please, **don't harass anyone over this**. Harassment and hate are *not* beneficial and won't go anywhere. If you'd like to stop supporting him, that's great. Just please do so *peacefully*. If you'd like to stay and keep sticking with Fixed Minecraft, that's also fine. We hold no grudges against anyone who does so. It's entirely up to you what you decide to do.

With that being said: If you're interested in our derivation of the project: Harmony (a server-side mod) and its sister mod Melody (a client/server mod), you can join us at the link below! We plan to have a more open, transparent development process and team with *no primary leader*. Community input is heavily encouraged and taken into account for the conceptualizing and development of features, rather than just one person. We welcome all and have a very accepting community.

And again, we're sorry it's come down to this, but we hope you understand the decision. We wish the best for everyone involved with this project.
