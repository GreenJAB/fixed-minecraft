Minecraft is a game with history that has gone through many updates. Many improved the game, but many also brought about problems, either in their original form or threw off the balance of existing mechanics. This mod aims to bring new balance to these broken or forgotten mechanics, to bring new life and creativity to the game. The biggest change has to do with the enchanting system, but this mod touches everything from transport, villagers, combat, inventory, maps, night time, terrain, the dragon, advancements, and so much more. This mod is not trying to add any major new mechanics (apart from a few things here and there), nor remove existing ones. It is not trying to fundamentally change the game, just give small but important tweaks here and there to bring everything together. So, if you are tired of the 2-week phase, give this a try.

### This Mod requires:
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- 1.20.4: [Kotlin Programming Language Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)

If have you never played modded Minecraft before, go to the [Fabric Homepage](https://fabricmc.net/) and download the downloader. Run it for the version of your choice, then in your minecraft folder (you can find by pressing open world folder ingame) there should be a mod folder. In it place the .jar file for this mod along with chosen version of the required mods listed above. Launch the game with fabric version selected. Now go create a new world. If you wish to make a server, this is needed on both server and client.

This mod is intended to feel vanilla and thus has designed to be plug and play with no external large set of mod options as many other mods have. Many of the features of this mod interact and overlap with one another and thus changing/removing features will break the mod. Many elements like the enchanting changes are far too entrenched to have any chance of being toggled off, some like the horse changes are purely positive, and others although negative like the elytra changes, are balanced by said positive changes. Besides, if enough people are excessively wanting to remove one of my changes, then I have failed in fixing that mechanic and so instead of adding a toggle to remove it, I would rather continue working on it until it is in a state where people would be happy to use my changes.
