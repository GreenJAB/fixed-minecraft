Enchanting Features:
    Anvil cost is solely based on the output item (no increasing anvil use).
     -> 1 lvl per ench power
     -> + extra cost per tool material
     -> curses decrease xp cost

    Revamp xp cost of enchants (I.e mending more expensive) and make the level cap different for each item (showcased via a bar in the anvil UI). Curses decrease the xp cost

    Repairing doesn’t require the base material but using it reduces the xp cost (however if the base xp cost is over the limit it will stay that way)

    Enchantment Power:
        - Top Down: Max lvl = max enchantment power; e.g. Mending ^= Sharp 5, da beide max lvl
        - max ench power for diff items
        - overenchanted loot


    Chiseled bookshelves around ench tables
        -> chance to apply the enchantments onto the gear (works with treasure ench/curses)


    Remove ability to enchant books


Still to do:
    Enchantment Power:
            - max ench power for diff items
            - overenchanted loot

    Anvil cost is solely based on the output item (no increasing anvil use).
         -> + extra cost per tool material
         -> curses decrease xp cost

    Repairing doesn’t require the base material but using it reduces the xp cost (however if the base xp cost is over the limit it will stay that way)
    -> idea instead: use grindstone to "sharpen" tools and gain durability, but it removes some enchantment points of the max limit of the item


Done:
    Enchantment Power:
        - Top Down: Max lvl = max enchantment power; e.g. Mending ^= Sharp 5, cuz both max lvl
      getEnchantmentPower(Enchantment enchantment, int level)

    Anvil cost is solely based on the output item (no increasing anvil use).
        -> 1 lvl per ench power
